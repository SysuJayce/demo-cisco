					<p>This week the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> Podcast&#8217;s guest rockstar wasÂ Sirish Raghuram. He&#8217;s the co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.platform9.com" target="_blank"><font color="red">Platform9</font></a> (www.platform9.com), and he&#8217;s also a former long-term <font color="red">VMware</font> employee. From that unique vantage point, he was able to contribute terrific insights about why enterprises haven&#8217;t fully embraced the <font color="red">cloud</font> yet and why <font color="red">VMware</font> Integrated <font color="red">OpenStack</font> is probably a net win for the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community. He also spoke about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why he founded <font color="red">Platform9</font></li>
<li>What <font color="red">Platform9</font> provides</li>
<li>How <font color="red">containers</font> may change the meaning of <font color="red">PaaS</font></li>
<li>Why 2015 &amp; 2016 will be the turning point for enterprise <font color="red">cloud</font> adoption</li>
<li>Why his team uses <font color="red">Ansible</font> for configuration management</li>
<li>Who he thinks has done mind-blowing work in the tech world</li>
<li>What the current monthly Amazon spending break point is, and how we might bring it down</li>

<p>Jeff:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Hi, everyone. Iâm Jeff Dickey from Redapt.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I am Niki Acosta from <font color="red">Cisco</font>, and we are super, super, super stoked today to have a very special guest from <font color="red">Platform9</font>, Sirish Raghuram. Did I say that right?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah, you got it Niki. Thank you for having me and itâs great to be here today.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Awesome. Sirish, we are really excited. The impetus behind Sirish joining the show today is, I donât know about rest of the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community, but Iâve been hearing a lot about <font color="red">Platform9</font>. They are getting a lot of attention. What they are doing is incredibly cool. We wanted to bring Sirish on today to talk about it, because they havenât been part of the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community for long, but as we discussed prior to the show, they actually have good timing in what they are trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>Sirish, before we get into all of that, we usually like to start the show by asking how you got started in tech. Tell us about your roots, your interesting time with <font color="red">VMware</font> and now leading up to, of course, <font color="red">Platform9</font>.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sure, absolutely. I grew up in India. I was studying engineering, and thatâs when I got my first PC. I discovered the whole World of Warcraft and Age of Empires. Multiplayer real time strategy games are where itâs at, if you ask me. In the middle I would write some code as well. I really took to it. Programming, technology, computer science, it felt like home for me. I graduated. After graduating from Pune I was fortunate to get connected with <font color="red">VMware</font>, and thatâs how I got started at <font color="red">VMware</font>.</p>
<p>My first assignment at <font color="red">VMware</font> was making Windows XP Boot, our workstation, <font color="red">VMware</font> Workstation 3, because they changed the SCSI style. Microsoft changed the SCSI style. One thing led to another, and I spend 13 years in <font color="red">VMware</font> engineering across many different groups and functions. [inaudible 00:01:58] engineering get a hands on technical leadership or engineering management. Now, here we are with <font color="red">OpenStack</font> and <font color="red">Platform9</font>. The key insight was that, for all of <font color="red">virtualizations</font> success and dominance in the enterprise, the enterprise customer still is struggling to put it all together as a <font color="blue">private cloud</font>. The answer has obviously got something to do with <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. We started with <font color="red">Platform9</font> to make it really simple and easy for anyone at any scale run their own <font color="blue">private cloud</font>.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Jeff, you look like you want to ask something.</p>
<p>Jeff:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  When did you decide that you are going to build this <font color="red">OpenStack</font>-based company? What was that? What was happening? What was going on?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah. I get asked about OpenStack a lot, especially given my background at <font color="red">VMware</font>. If you think about it, the way we thought about it is, there needs to be a <font color="red">cloud platform</font>. We didnât feel like <font color="red">VMware</font>âs in-house <font color="red">cloud platform</font> solutions were the answer. Then when we thought about solving that problem, we could have gone and written something entirely our own or use something like <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, and we also looked at CloudStack. The answer was very easy that it had to be <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, because of, think about it from a customerâs point of view. There is this enormous ecosystem of leverage. Their <font color="red">API</font> endpoints are standardized; there is tools that work with them; the storage and network systems that integrate with them. You get the standard <font color="red">API</font>.</p>
<p><font color="red">OpenStack</font> has become a, or has become a standard for the <font color="red">data center</font>. Itâs something that the customer wins if you do it. Architecturally, <font color="red">OpenStack</font> doesnât get the credit that it deserves. Itâs actually a very reasonable loosely coupled service-oriented architecture. Why wouldnât we use <font color="red">OpenStack</font> as opposed to rolling something entirely our own? Weâre trying to solve a problem, and <font color="red">OpenStack</font> is a part of that solution.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  <font color="red">VMware</font> launched their <font color="red">OpenStack</font> services distro or whatever. Assumingly, from what I read on ESX, is that posing a threat you think to other players in the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> space given their market dominance over the last ten years?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Itâs a great thing for <font color="red">OpenStack</font> and the space in general, because if you look at whatâs happened, and Iâve had the opportunity to talk to two or three really large <font color="red">VMware</font> accounts that either participated in the VIO Beta or were the kind of customer that <font color="red">VMware</font> was trying to retain by launching <font color="red">VMware</font> Integrated <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. The answer was that these customers had come to the conclusion that <font color="red">VMware</font>âs existing <font color="red">cloud platform</font> solutions werenât going to cut it. They needed something which is more like Amazon. The natural answer was to look at something like <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. <font color="red">OpenStack</font> hasÂ this fantastic benefit of saying that here is an <font color="red">API</font> that a number of different vendors can potentially implement for you. Be that Metacloud or be that <font color="red">Platform9</font> or <font color="red">VMware</font> or any of the other <font color="red">OpenStack</font> vendors.</p>
<p>For a customer, it puts them in a position where they have more leverage as opposed to if they were using the proprietary vCloud <font color="red">API</font>, theyâre completely beholden to <font color="red">VMware</font>. Not just that, the design was something thatâs a lot more modern. <font color="red">OpenStack</font>âs design is a lot more familiar to a world which is using a lot more Amazon Web Services. <font color="red">VMware</font> did a very good thing in realizing that they needed to have an <font color="red">OpenStack</font> solution. Now, for the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> market it suddenly makes brings on â¦ expands the addressable markets 5X. Eighty percent of an enterprise or seventy percent of the enterprise is still running a lot of <font color="red">VMware</font>. All of those people previously werenât really addressable to the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community.</p>
<p>Now, suddenly that community is realizing that <font color="red">OpenStack</font> is actually a vCloud platform that they need to be thinking about as well. It expands the addressable market so much. It more than offsets the competition from <font color="red">VMware</font>, and now itâs up to the individual vendors to add on their own value adds and differentiation and compete with <font color="red">VMware</font>. Itâs a great thing for everyone.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Do you think that people who are using <font color="red">VMware</font> Integrated <font color="red">OpenStack</font> are going to use it to do a kick the tires kind of environment, and then potentially choose another route for <font color="red">OpenStack</font>? Or do you think, for those particular users that they are going to do <font color="red">VMware</font> Integrated <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, and over time it will get better and will stick with it?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Itâll be like predicting which way the future â¦ which way it works out. Itâs a little hard to do. I do think that the people who are looking at <font color="red">OpenStack</font> are also realizing that there are other <font color="red">hypervisors</font> out there. There is this newfangled technology called <font color="red">containers</font>, which is very interesting as well. They are looking to achieve greater <font color="red">infrastructure automation</font>. They look at <font color="red">VMware</font> integrated <font color="red">OpenStack</font> as a path, as a stepping stone in the path for their internal infrastructure and that path is going to take them down a path where there is more automation, multiple <font color="red">hypervisors</font>, more loosely coupled distributed Linux-oriented services.</p>
<p>For some, itâs a stepping stone thatâs comfortable. It comes from a trusted brand, <font color="red">VMware</font> that they trust. For others, itâs a way to test the waters in <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, while actually looking to make a bigger jump into the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thatâs interesting that you say that. In a lot of ways, I see that a lot of people are now seeing <font color="red">VMware</font> as a direct threat. The same people have to be very careful because they have these historical strong relationships and partnerships with <font color="red">VMware</font>. It will be interesting to see how all that shakes out, which brings me to the whole reason we had you here. It sounds like from <font color="red">Platform9</font>âs perspective that you guys are actually trying to help these types of customers who are dealing with multi <font color="red">hypervisors</font>, multi target <font color="red">clouds</font>. Can you tell us a little bit about the impetus behind finding <font color="red">Platform9</font>, and what you guys do to help solve these challenges?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sure, absolutely. Iâd say, I was at <font color="red">VMware</font> for 12 years. When you are in a company as successful as <font color="red">VMware</font> was, it was a fantastic culture there. Itâs very easy to get locked into your own cocoon and that certainly happened with us. There was a conversation I got pulled into with a San Francisco based startup in 2013 where they were having a massive spend on Amazon Web Services. They had grown from being a 20-person company to a 600-person company. They wanted now to move off of Amazon and run their own infrastructure. I was brought into help answer their questions and to show them how they could do it with <font color="red">VMware</font>âs solutions.</p>
<p>When we actually started having the conversation with them, I realized that they didnât think it was easy or viable for them to build a <font color="blue">private cloud</font>. I was like, look, there areÂ all these solutions. There is <font color="red">VMware</font>, there is <font color="red">OpenStack</font>&#8230; all these things. They said, âLook, our operational team is eight people; we will need to get to 20 people in order to pull this off.â I realized that â¦ if you think about it, the cost for the company was such that they couldnât do it. They continued using Amazon for far longer than they wanted to, because they felt there was no other solution that they could really implement successfully. That was a shock to the system, to me when I realized that for all of <font color="red">virtualization</font>âs successâ¦<font color="red">virtualization</font> is really the underpinning of <font color="red">cloud infrastructure</font>&#8230;on the <font color="blue">private cloud</font> side people struggle with it so much. This is a very sophisticated team I am talking about. These people were, Iâd say, power users to put it mildly, and they werenât confident of pulling off a <font color="blue">private cloud</font>. Thatâs when I realized that there is a problem that needs to be solved, and we said we are going to go solve it. We started <font color="red">Platform9</font> with a goal to make it â¦ We asked ourselves, why is it so hard? When people can rack and stack hardware and put Linux on it very easily, Why is it so hard to go from racks of Linux or racks of <font color="red">VMware</font> vSphere into your own mini Amazon? There is no good reason for that to be the case.</p>
<p>We started <font color="red">Platform9</font> with a goal. We asked ourselves, if someone has racks of Linux or racks of <font color="red">VMware</font>, can we get that <font color="blue">private cloud</font> operational in five minutes? Thatâs a goal we have for ourselves. We do that by hosting <font color="red">OpenStack</font> as a web service. Itâs a <font color="red">cloud service</font>, which means that customers sign up at <font color="red">Platform9</font> and they get a fully tuned production-ready <font color="red">OpenStack</font> <font color="red">control plane</font> that they can plug in their infrastructure with it, which means that suddenly they donât need to spend any time in that complex management layer which they struggle to develop. They have the hardware, thatâs not the hard part for them. For them, itâs a management fabric that pools that hardware together into a <font color="blue">private cloud</font>, and we took all that pain away by saying, âYou donât need to install it; you donât need to configure it; you donât need to monitor anything; you donât need to troubleshoot anything, and you donât need to have ways and means by which you can resolve issues and roll out actions in your advantage.â</p>
<p>We takeÂ all of the responsibility of delivering the <font color="red">control plane</font> to you with an SLA that you can rely on. You can actually focus on using your <font color="blue">private cloud</font> and going on to achieve greater infrastructure agility and automation as opposed to trying to get it up and running.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Are you operating the <font color="red">cloud</font> long term? I am assuming you guys are handling upgrades and all that good stuff too.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah. Thatâs actually the most important thing. If you look at getting an <font color="red">OpenStack</font> <font color="red">control plane</font> up, there are many different ways of doing it today. There is Pathstack, RDO, Mirantis, DevStack. There is many different ways by which you can get an <font color="red">OpenStack</font> instance up and running. Thatâs not the hard part. The hard part is keeping it running, in production, at scale while you have users using it. Thatâs where you need to have the full loop between â¦ You need to have telemetry that monitors your <font color="red">OpenStack</font> services for health and detects issues that are happening, that are going around. You need to have telemetry that then goes and has the ability to alert the concerned engineers, and then they have the ability to roll in and resolve issues proactively. Especially a lot of the automation that Amazon Web Services has in their management fabric in terms of keeping it running at production at scale. Thatâs whatâs needed in the <font color="blue">private cloud</font>. Thatâs why we deliver <font color="red">Platform9</font> as a service with an SLA saying that, âLook, your <font color="red">control plane</font> is our responsibility; you donât have to miss a beat. You can use it and we will take complete responsibility for its availability, its scalability, its performance and its upgrade SLAs and so forth. All of that goes out of the window; we take care of them freely.â</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I read on your website, one of the goals or the intentions of <font color="red">Platform9</font>, Iâm not sure if this is something that exists today or something thatâs on your roadmap. Your intent is to have multi <font color="red">hypervisor</font> support, is that correct?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  That is correct. We declared general availability for KVM and [inaudible 00:13:00]; thatâs about six weeks ago. We are actually now in beta with <font color="red">VMware</font> vSphere. We have some really large customers who have massive <font color="red">VMware</font> deployments who are very excited about what we are doing. After we are done with <font color="red">VMware</font>, we will be announcing updates on <font color="red">Docker</font> as well. Essentially, ESX is still the worldâs best <font color="red">hypervisor</font>, but you donât need it for every <font color="red">workload</font> that you run. If all you are trying to do is CI and CD and test and dev automation, you donât need a lot of the features that <font color="red">VMware</font> ESX has. You may legitimately choose to use KVM, or maybe you will start to move to micro services architecture and maybe use more <font color="red">containers</font>.</p>
<p>We think that the <font color="blue">private cloud</font> has to be decoupled from your choice of <font color="red">virtualization</font> platform and customers should be free to choose any mix of <font color="red">virtualization</font> technologies that works for them. They may now â¦ the production <font color="red">workloads</font> that need higher SLA and a very resilient underlying infrastructure on <font color="red">VMware</font> or they may run newer applications and <font color="red">containers</font> and test and dev work that will â¦</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I think we lost Sirish. Sirish, can you hear us?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Platforms that work for them, and we want to enable them to use that in the <font color="blue">private cloud</font> seamlessly.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Looks like we lost you there for a second, but I think I got the basic gist of what you were saying. How do you â¦ Letâs say, hypothetically you got your <font color="red">OpenStack</font> [inaudible 00:14:35] <font color="red">Platform9</font>; youâve got <font color="red">workload</font> and you want that <font color="red">workload</font> to target a <font color="red">VMware</font> <font color="red">hypervisor</font>. Are you handling that through the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> layer to the scheduler, or is that happening on some other component that might be â¦ <font color="red">Platform9</font>âs kind of secret sauce?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We are all based on <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. Let me actually walk over to a location where I probably have better wireless range. Itâs all based on <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. Yeah, we are an <font color="red">OpenStack</font> based company, and we will continue to remain on <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. What we do is have the scheduling logic to integrate with <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, the KVM based resources that an organization might have as well as any <font color="red">VMware</font> resources. Both of these resources can be pulled into one <font color="blue">private cloud</font>. What that means is that you can then deploy your virtual machines regardless of whether that image is a <font color="red">VMware</font> image or a KVM image. The scheduler has the ability to look at based on the image type that you are trying to deploy from; if it will have the ability to actually pick the right underlying infrastructure.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Very cool. Then to the user, those are all going to appear in the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> dashboard, right?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  It looks exactly the same. <font color="red">OpenStack</font> Glance image library represents all of the images that you have. It looks exactly the same. The user doesnât even see the differences between <font color="red">VMware</font> underneath or KVM underneath.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  How are you handling storage? Thatâs always the big one. It sounds like everyone that weâve talked to on the show has a different spin on block storage, volumes, and object storage.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A lot of the challenge with <font color="red">OpenStack</font> is in actually â¦ Itâs like a framework. Itâs like a kernel that you can use to do many different things. I think the challenge is in putting it together in a way by which you eliminate, subdue that complexity that arises from the million different ways of doing things. With <font color="red">Platform9</font> the philosophy is as simple as, if you deploying a block storage device today, you have a server, letâs say, thatâs hooked up with storage. It could be direct attached storage or it could be network attached storage. When you import that server into <font color="red">Platform9</font>, the way you do it is you sign up for your <font color="red">Platform9</font> <font color="red">control plane</font> and you download an agent and drop it on to that server, and that enables the trust and management relationship between your server and your <font color="red">Platform9</font> <font color="red">control plane</font>.</p>
<p>When you do that that agent introspects any storage thatâs available on that server, be it direct attached storage or network attached storage, and seamlessly imports that via the nova and the Glance and the Cinder APIs in <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. Likewise on network as well, on storage and the network, the key achievement is in eliminating the complexity that people face when interfacing <font color="red">OpenStack</font> with the storage and network subsystems that they may have.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Are you using <font color="red">Neutron</font> currently?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We are moving to <font color="red">Neutron</font>. We were based on Nova network. Weâve only recently upgraded from <font color="red">OpenStack</font> Havana to <font color="red">OpenStack</font> Juno. By the way thatâs a story in itself, because our customers next week are â¦ As of now many of customers are still on <font color="red">OpenStack</font> Havana, we are actually rolling out this upgrade next week. They are going to get an email. Their upgrade process looks like this. They get an email saying, hey, there is a 15 minute downtime scheduled for this time, next week; let us know if you want to reschedule it. They donât lift a finger, right? At the end of that downtime period they get an <font color="red">OpenStack</font> Juno enrollment completely up and running. They donât need to lift a finger, it all works for them. Itâs completely touchless from their point of view.</p>
<p>As part of the Juno upgrade, a key driver to upgrade to Juno was to move to the more stable <font color="red">Neutron</font> implementation in Juno, because we did look at <font color="red">Neutron</font> in Havana, but we decided to stick with nova network for its stability there. In Juno we are actually making greater use of Cinder and <font color="red">Neutron</font>.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Very cool. Jeff, I feel like Iâve asked a barrage of questions, and I think itâs your turn.</p>
<p>Jeff:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Youâve asked some great questions. It has been good. What does size and scale look like for you guys? Whatâs the ideal customer and how large do you guys go?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We actually have a lot of inbound interest from very small customers. Itâs a lot of the fact that small customers who may previously have said, â<font color="red">OpenStack</font>; no way; thatâs too complex for me.â We are making it accessible, so easy for them that many people sign up and get up and running very quickly. The sweet spot, is I think, that <font color="red">OpenStack</font> solves problems at scale. You have a certain minimum scale at which the value proposition for <font color="red">OpenStack</font> in <font color="red">infrastructure automation</font> and resource pooling really becomes very high. We think that that scale is somewhere between 50 servers and on up. Fifty physical servers and on up.</p>
<p>Our largest customer plans to reply us on a couple of thousand servers by 2017. They are starting small with a 50 server deployment right now, but they are licensing <font color="red">Platform9</font> statewide. We have, Iâd say, five customers that plan to get to the thousands of physical server scale, but they are not there yet today. The way infrastructure software works is they tend to test at first at 20 server scale, then 50 server, 100 server and they scale veryÂ simply. Very few of them flip a switch and say, âWe are going to run this in 2000 servers tomorrow.â</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Are you deploying this in a hosted model, or is this a customer premise implementation?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The infrastructure, the actual resources, the compute and the storage and the network resources that they are using always tends to be within the customersâ premises. The <font color="red">control plane</font> for all of these customers is hosted by <font color="red">Platform9</font>. Now, we do have, Iâd say, there is ten percent of our customer inbound that wants a purely on-premises solution. We donât have that today. It is something we are architecturally designed to do. We could make it up available relatively quickly. Itâs a matter of prioritizing our backlog and getting first things done first.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Very cool. Thatâs a great model. If you can centralize the <font color="red">control plane</font> and then still give the customers the warm and fuzzies knowing that their <font color="red">VMs</font> are still within their four walls. I think thatâs pretty brilliant.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The insight there was, today there are so many customers that are distributed themselves. For example, our biggest customer has five different geographies. They have <font color="red">data centers</font> in San Francisco, New York, Amsterdam, Japan, and India. What is on premises anymore? They donât want to have five different management systems for each <font color="red">data center</font>. They want to have a <font color="red">single pane</font> of glass, and they want to use these <font color="red">data centers</font> with regions a lot like the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/solutions/trends/cloud/build-public-cloud.html" title="<font color="blue">public cloud</font>" target="_blank" class="seoal-link">public cloud</a>. The realization we had was as you get to â¦ as the world gets increasingly decentralized, people are coming to realize that you need a management fabric for the <font color="blue">private cloud</font> that spans the globe regardless of where your actual infrastructure is. Then you are free to plug and play with infrastructure in different geographies.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I did see tooâ¦ I think it was on your supported platform page, maybe it was a different page. It looked like there was going to be or there is some integration to some of the more popular <font color="blue">public cloud</font> platforms as well. Is that right?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  That is something we get asked for. We do get asked in particular about Amazon, and whether customers could bring in the <font color="red">single pane</font> across their internal infrastructure and the public infrastructure. Again, this is something thatâs maybe applicable to <font color="red">OpenStack</font> in general. <font color="red">OpenStack</font> should become â¦ Itâs a standard. It is a de facto standard for how to consume infrastructure in the enterprise context. <font color="red">OpenStack</font> itself should have a provider, a driver that can let it use Amazon capacity or Google compute capacity in the backend. Stuff that we want to do, again, there is a lot of interesting things you do, and you have to choose first things first.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Go ahead, Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Can you hear me? Iâm curious about the multi-tenant, what you guys are doing around that, and then the collaboration.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Multi tenancy in the context of our customer accounts themselves and how weâ¦ â¦</p>
<p>Jeff:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  How do you solve that problem that seems to be a big issue?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  There is two handles to multi tenancy with <font color="red">Platform9</font>, because we are a SaaS based management fabric. We do not share customer <font color="red">data</font>. For every customer account, we bring up a dedicated <font color="red">control plane</font> instance as opposed to maybe letting multiple accounts share the same <font color="red">control plane</font>. That was a factor â¦ It comes out of the fact that even though itâs only hosting metadata, the <font color="red">control plane</font> only has access to metadata. It does not really have any <font color="red">VM</font> images or <font color="red">VM</font> instances. It still is sensitive <font color="red">data</font> that we did not want to risk any compromises around.</p>
<p>Every <font color="red">control plane</font> has its own dedicated root certificate authority and all of the metadata communication that happens between the <font color="red">data plane</font> software, the software thatâs running on the hardware that is being managed by that <font color="red">OpenStack</font> instance, is encrypted, strongly encrypted with certificates that are dedicated to that root certificate authority. Even we donât have access to the metadata thatâs stored by the <font color="red">control plane</font> for our servers, for our customers I mean. Nor do customers share anything. They share nothing other than the fact that it is the same company thatâs servicing them, but their <font color="red">control plane</font> is entirely isolated. It can be locked down to their network range.</p>
<p>If you sign up as a customer to <font color="red">Platform9</font>, you can configure your <font color="red">Platform9</font> <font color="red">control plane</font> to be accessible only from your networks. Thatâs on the multi tenancy on our end. Itâs a model that works very, very simply, and addresses most of these info side questions that customers tend to have.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  One thing that seems to be challenging too, at least from the operator perspective is being able to monitor the entire stack all the way from the bare-mental instance all the way up through the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> layer and potentially beyond. How are you guys handling telemetry and monitoring? Why did you make the decision that you made? There is a lot of choices out there obviously.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  There is a lot of choices. Look, I wouldnât claim that this is the only way to do it. What we do have is something thatâs working very well. Let me explain what we do. Our architecture, again, has the <font color="red">control plane</font> and it has a <font color="red">data plane</font>. What we have is the <font color="red">control plane</font> itself aggregates key logs and monitors statistics and <font color="red">API</font> calls from the <font color="red">data plane</font>. The <font color="red">data plane</font> actually rose itself and exposed it to the <font color="red">control plane</font> where we have collectors. We have collectors in the <font color="red">control plane</font> as well, which are internally piped into our own centralized log monitoring infrastructure.</p>
<p>We monitor not just logs for possible error traces, but also <font color="red">API</font> traces, and performance latency. All of that is then hooked into â¦ we use paper trail internally. We could be using the ELK framework; we actually then pipe that into our alerting system, which is VictorOps. When a customer runs into an error, literally my cell phone goes off, the VictorOpsÂ app on my cell phone goes off. For those who are not familiar with VictorOps, VictorOpsÂ is a lot like page equity. They are conceptually very similar.</p>
<p>The net result is, when our customers are using <font color="red">Platform9</font>, when something fails we see it sometimes before they even realize something failed. We can then jump on it and resolve it. We have actually fixed issues without customers ever telling us there was a problem.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Were you guys out with Ceilometer? Is there any component of Ceilometer that you are using now, and in full disclosure that there is plenty of people who donât much like those people who are not yet on <font color="red">Neutron</font>. How are you handling that?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We are not on Ceilometer yet. We started <font color="red">OpenStack</font> now has 15 different services. Itâs a matter of prioritizing the ones that we are doing first before the others. Ceilometer gets â¦ it does come up. Service providers in particular look at Ceilometer as a way for them to enable billing. Now, there are dedicated solutions that they could be using. They could also be running Ceilometer themselves and integrating that with their <font color="red">Platform9</font> endpoint. There are solutions that we offer to these customers today, but itâs not something thatâs included in the <font color="red">Platform9</font> core distribution today.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Iâm assuming, along the way, you guys are doing bug fixes in contributing stuff back up to <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. How do you determine what tries to go back to <font color="red">OpenStack</font> and what doesnât?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We do make a lot of bug fixes. I did some queries last year. At some point weâve made 400 bug fixes in six months. Look, a lot of those are probably specific to the way in which we package and deliver our software. Itâs how much of those are core bugs was a matter of packaging. The line is sometimes fuzzy. We are not yet in a position where we are contributing these fixes back. The reason is, the time it takes for us to file a blueprint or file an issue and then push the patch back, right now, is not something that we are not able to spend. Itâs something we absolutely want to do. Itâs a matter of time. Iâd say, by the end of this year, we aim to be starting pushing a lot more contributions back into the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> framework.</p>
<p>We donât think of differentiating ourselves by virtue of our IP. We think of differentiating ourselves where the fact that we run this as a service thatâs very easy for people to consume. We want <font color="red">OpenStack</font> itself to get stronger and better over time. It is something we need to start doing more of towards the end of this year.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah. I hear that from a lot of folks that the amount of time that it takes for stuff to get pushed through and whether or not it gets accepted can be a kind of difficult process. You talked a lot about what you love about <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, whatâs on your wish list for <font color="red">OpenStack</font>?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Can I say, simplified networking?</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sure.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, when we started, we were, Iâd say, a lot more skeptical. We were very careful with our choice. Then when you look at it from a customer perspective, this was absolutely the right choice to make, and the fact that the architecture, itâs got good bones. I donât think <font color="red">OpenStack</font> gets enough credit for that. Itâs credit to a lot of the people in the community whoâve gotten it to this point. Itâs incredible for an open sourced project to have developed so asynchronously and so organically to have achieved everything that it has so far. Things that I wish were clearer; I think networking should be simpler. We are doing that; <font color="red">Platform9</font> is solving that problem. I donât see why anyone who is trying <font color="red">OpenStack</font> has to lose their minds over networking complexity.</p>
<p>I also think that the <font color="red">container</font> story, itâs coming together. We are very excited about Project Magnum and we are watching it very closely. Itâs something thatâs very important for <font color="red">OpenStack</font> to address. Heat <font color="red">orchestration</font>, there is a lot of noise especially from the <font color="red">Docker</font> and <font color="red">container</font> space these days about <font color="red">orchestration</font> solutions. There is probably more than, can fill our one hour podcast that you can talk about. And Kubernetes itself is somewhat of an <font color="red">orchestration</font> solution.</p>
<p><font color="red">OpenStack</font> Heat looks great, because itâs actually very similar to Amazon <font color="red">cloud</font> formation. I wish that we are able to better clarify to the world at large why <font color="red">OpenStack</font> Heat is a better way to orchestrate your applications across <font color="red">containers</font> and across <font color="red">VMs</font> over time. Three things Iâd say: simplified networking, better and native support for <font color="red">containers</font> as <font color="red">containers</font> develop, and the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> <font color="red">orchestration</font> project should become the de facto, hopefully subsuming all of the functionality that you can get from proprietary <font color="red">orchestration</font> solutions.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Itâs interesting that you brought that up about Heat. Certainly there seems to be differences in opinion as far as how you are going to solve <font color="red">application deployment</font>. Weâve talked to Mirantis and theyâve got a ton of people working on Murano. It seems like <font color="red">containers</font> introduced this new way of thinking. Do you think it is <font color="red">OpenStack</font>âs job to determine what that process should look like? Or should it be somewhat abstracted similar to, letâs say, block storage where you could very easily change the underpinnings and still have a same outcome?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This is exactly the concern that I have, Niki, which is that there is a lot of noise and fragmentation in the <font color="red">orchestration</font> space; there is maybe a couple of different ways of thinking about it within the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community itself. Heat is obviously whatâs in the project, but there are new proposals out there. Especially in the <font color="red">container</font> world there is a ton of different ways of thinking about it. There is Kubernetes and <font color="red">Docker</font> seems to have its own <font color="red">orchestration</font> mechanism coming up. There is new startups being announced all the time. My concern with that is that when you have that level of fragmentation for a customer, it can actually slow you down. You are not sure which path is a dead end and which path is a good path to take.</p>
<p>That is something that I think, we, the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community should hopefully resolve quickly enough saying, go down this path and you will not go â¦ promise to a customer that this is not a dead end, and that there is interoperability. If you decide to move from <font color="red">VMs</font> to <font color="red">containers</font>, this is still going to be relevant by being able to tell customers. If you orchestrate your applications through <font color="red">OpenStack</font> Heat say, then regardless of how your application architecture evolves over time, this is still going to be useful, itâs still going to help you orchestrate your application. I think that is the promise that the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community needs to be able to make to users.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah, thatâs a good point. What about <font color="red">PaaS</font>? Especially over the last two months, Iâve heard from enterprise companies that there is at least some desire to start exploring <font color="red">PaaS</font> solutions. Do you have any opinions on <font color="red">PaaS</font>?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I do. This is probably going to be more a connection of related thoughts as opposed to a very coherent point. I will give credit where it is due. It [inaudible 00:33:15] articulated this in one of his recent blogs is, <font color="red">containers</font> seem to impact <font color="red">PaaS</font> in interesting ways. Previously â¦ letâs go back a year. You probably would think about <font color="red">PaaS</font> as being <font color="red">Cloud</font> Foundry or maybe Aprenda or OpenShift. Now, if you fundamentally have a very, very portable lightweight construct called a <font color="red">container</font> which lets you deploy a unit very easily. If there is a way to orchestrate your application layer across <font color="red">containers</font> then, is PsaS really something that you can compose in many different ways. There is a number of different solutions to <font color="red">PaaS</font> that emerge all delivered in the containerized format.</p>
<p>So you can literally bring up a custom combination of a <font color="red">PaaS</font> solution that makes sense for you because of <font color="red">containers</font> making it so easy to deploy these application services. It maybe that <font color="red">containers</font> are going to change <font color="red">PaaS</font> meant. <font color="red">PaaS</font> meant <font color="red">Cloud</font> Foundry or OpenShift over time, but maybe in the future <font color="red">PaaS</font> is going to evolve to a dynamically and easily composed construct of application services that are deployed in <font color="red">containers</font>.</p>
<p>The actual services themselves; there is going to be many different <font color="red">load balancing</font> solutions; there is going to be many different solutions for specific features in <font color="red">PaaS</font>. So I think <font color="red">PaaS</font> is going to happen. I donât think itâs going to happen in the way maybe <font color="red">Cloud</font> Foundry and OpenShift were going about it in their first generation. They have really smart people there, and Iâm sure they are updating their roadmaps with watching this happen.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This could be interesting to see how the <font color="red">PaaS</font> story shakes out. Ultimately, the whole goal intent is to make is easy for developers to develop applications without having to spend time on things like load balancers or things that may not be critical to the actual app components, right?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Exactly. Definitely the world is getting there. Itâs probably been a slower journey than many of us might have hoped for, but people are definitely getting there. You need a really solid infrastructure as a service substrate on top of which you can deploy these application services. Now, we are in a point where people are starting to get more successful with <font color="red">OpenStack</font> as that infrastructure substrate. The next level is going to build on top of this substance.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  How long do you think it is before â¦ we certainly see it happening now, but if you â¦ I get the impression based on the conversations that I have that enterprises are slightly behind the pack in terms of <font color="red">cloud</font> adoption in general to some extent. I wouldnât say that it is true across the board of all enterprises, but certainly there are pockets of folks within the enterprise who are branching out and doing more exploration with <font color="red">cloud</font> or maybe deploying stuff on <font color="red">cloud</font>. How long before <font color="red">OpenStack</font> hits critical mass for the enterprise?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I think 2015 and 2016 are going to be the turning point. The reason is this. In defense of the enterprise; if you look at the first generation <font color="red">OpenStack</font> solutions, look at the enterprise; it had 80 percent of its deployments, <font color="red">virtualization</font>, infrastructure was <font color="red">VMware</font>. Til <font color="red">Platform9</font> came around, and maybe now with <font color="red">VMware</font> integrated <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, you didnât really have any <font color="red">OpenStack</font> vendor make supporting <font color="red">VMware</font> as a platform a top priority, which meant that it was hard. It was a bit of a core reboot of the <font color="red">data center</font> stack. These are people who understand the benefits of <font color="red">cloud computing</font>.</p>
<p>They do have a lot of their existing infrastructure that they have to manage. I donât think the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community made it as easy and straightforward to mix and match existing environments and existing <font color="red">workloads</font> with new <font color="red">cloud</font> centric <font color="red">workloads</font>. In the enterprise itâs not a boolean. We are always going to be statically virtualized or we are only going to have a <font color="red">cloud computing</font> model. It shades of grey. Itâs a gradual transformation that happens. The <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community did not make it easy and seamless to get on the journey with a very seamless path.</p>
<p>I think of what we do at <font color="red">Platform9</font> as solving that problem, what <font color="red">VMware</font> is trying to do with <font color="red">VMware</font> integrated <font color="red">OpenStack</font> is also trying to solve the problem, and I think there would be others as well. I do think that now the enterprise understands the benefits of <font color="red">cloud computing</font> and they do see viable paths to get to that end goal while using the assets that they may have and using technologies that they are familiar with. I think 2015 and 2016 are going to be critical, because while the mindshare and interest in <font color="red">OpenStack</font> is really high, for the first time there is the path to go from where they are in the enterprise to where they want to go, and in a very non-disruptive manner.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  You should have been a salesperson.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I should be. I hope that.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Iâm sure you did tons of it.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I really believe in this. The <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community should have made it easier for customers. The whole pets versus â¦ I spoke with Randy Bias about this as well. The whole pets versus cattle meme. I think it is pets and cattle. The reality is customers have a lot of pets, and that doesnât mean that their new <font color="red">application deployments</font> cannot â¦ We should have made it easier for them to use what they have, get it up and running, and progressively migrate their application architecture to the model that we are evangelizing, which is where they want to go. If you make it a very hard shift then it becomes very difficult to cross that chasm.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  You are like the ranch hand of pets versus cattle. I really want to see you in a cowboy hat and boots; Iâm going to throw that out there.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Next time Iâm in Texas, Iâm going to take a picture and send it to you, Niki.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, awesome. Letâs switch gears a little bit. Configuration management, obviously a lot of options out there; I am assuming you are probably have picked your configuration management slash automation tool of choice. Do you have any strong opinions on that?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I do. Iâm wondering if I should share it, because Iâm sure that your audience has strong opinions on it as well. I might tick off maybe 60% of your audience.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  They will get over it.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Okay. Are you sure?</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Positively. We have great viewers, the best in the world.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We started with Puppet internally and Packstack. For our <font color="red">use case</font> where â¦ The way we use configuration management internally is we obviously use it to orchestrate upgrades and new version deployments to offer <font color="red">control plane</font> across our customer deployments. We were using Puppet and Packstack, and it was a nightmare for us. I donât know if it was us or the tools, but it was really slow, and it kicked off the engineering team enough that they ripped the whole thing out and reload it from scratch in <font color="red">Ansible</font>. We actually try to find an existing <font color="red">Ansible</font> thing. We found a couple, but they didnât really meet the goals that we have, so we written it entirely from scratch using <font color="red">Ansible</font>.</p>
<p>We did look at Salt as well, but the reason we ultimately chose <font color="red">Ansible</font> is because it has this agentless architecture. We did have a couple of performance optimization issues we ran into there as well. The way the connections get made, you need to be able to reuse connections efficiently in <font color="red">Ansible</font>, otherwise it can get pretty slow as well. Now, the team really likes that. There is a lot of <font color="red">Ansible</font> diehards over here, so donât come in and say Puppet in this team.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah. I might know some <font color="red">Ansible</font> users myself, I wonât name any names, but the Metacloud team loves some <font color="red">Ansible</font> too. Jeff, I feel like Iâm hogging the mic.</p>
<p>Jeff:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I love when you do that. Itâs awesome you have such great questions. My only question is really like how did even get started? What do they have to do? Is there minimum requirements? Is there architectural guide for their existing equipment?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah. Itâs a great question, Jeff. The way you get started is you go to Platform9.com and you request your free trial, and usually in about 10 minutes you get a note saying, âHere is your new <font color="red">control plane</font> thatâs been deployed for you.â We have a support portal, and this is also referenced from our website with the requirements. Minimum requirements is you need to have a server which has network and storage attached and is running, Iâd say, CentOS 6.5 or sentora 6.5 or RHEL 6.5 or newer, [inaudible 00:41:40].</p>
<p>Yeah. You need to have network storage compute and you need to have a Linux operating system or you could be running <font color="red">VMware</font> vSphere. You go to <font color="red">Platform9</font>, request your trial, and you get up and running. The email that you get has instructions in terms of what you do next. Itâs very simple. You will all get a new download agent and you drop it on your server and start. For Linux or whether itâs CentOS or Ubuntu; itâs a small agent about three megabytes in size that enables trust between your servers and your <font color="red">Platform9</font> <font color="red">control plane</font>.</p>
<p>For <font color="red">VMware</font> that same agent is packaged as an OVA appliance. Itâs just that simple. Our support portal at support@platform9.com has how-toâs on how to setup your server if you are bringing the server from scratch. This is not rocket science. I think everyone who sets up Linux sets it up this way. There are specific articles for those who are looking for those material.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Iâm assuming that you are hiring?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We are, absolutely. Engineering, sales; we need people who can grow and who can hack it and run fast and are driven by <font color="red">customer success</font>, yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Will you be in Vancouver?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We will be in Vancouver. Itâs our first summit as a team. We are super excited. My co-founder Madhura was at Atlanta when we were in stealth. There was not so much fun. When you are in stealth, you canât talk about what you are doing very publicly. Itâs not fun. Harris came in. we miss Harris. We couldnât go, because weâve just done <font color="red">VM</font> World and Amazon reinvent and we were just stretched too thin. Vancouver is our first summit. We do have three big talks. I hope they get approved by the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community. We are looking forward to meeting with a lot of users there.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  What do you hope to gain from the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> Summit? What kind of talks are you going to be attending?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The talks that I want to attend are people who are using <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. We need to start talking about how are you using <font color="red">OpenStack</font> to really transform your business agility internally? Recently, last week I was on a call with a customer, it just blew my mind. They have an <font color="red">OpenStack</font> environment across a thousand servers, multiple <font color="red">OpenStack</font> controllers working managing a total of thousand servers with a home grown <font color="red">PaaS</font> layer that they have customized, which is routing <font color="red">load balancing</font> requests across these <font color="red">OpenStack</font> controllers, and that architecture was incredible to see.</p>
<p>There are a large software development organization, and they use this to achieve CI/CD automation within their environment. That was mind blowing to see that. There is a lot of users out there that are using <font color="red">OpenStack</font> to achieve incredible things. Iâd love to see more of those stories.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah. One that comes to mind is Wes Jossey, heâs a Metacloud customer, but theyâre running just a massive <font color="red">Hadoop</font> cluster on <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, and an interesting <font color="red">use case</font>. There is a lot of diehard, has-to-be-on-bare-metal type of folks that are out there. But they kind of said, âHey, thatâs not really that important to us for what we are trying to do, of course, it is <font color="red">workload</font> dependent.â But Iâm always kind of floored at how different peopleâs use of <font color="red">OpenStack</font>â¦ that range of what people are actually doing with <font color="red">OpenStack</font> is just mind blowing to me.</p>
<p>When I talk about <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, I tell peopleâ¦theyâre like âWhat is it good for?â I said, well, what are you doing on <font color="blue">public cloud</font> now? Itâs kind of a blank canvas. There is so many possibilities when you are looking at the combination of services that are available and people are using it certainly in very interesting ways. What is your most popular <font color="red">use case</font> at <font color="red">Platform9</font> this far?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Itâs definitely software development organizations that want their dev and test users to have two or three different things. They want to have a sandbox area where they can go in and quickly deploy test beds and spin up test beds and try out things within a self-service manner. They want to use it as a pool of a lab pool where they can run their CI and CD <font color="red">workloads</font>. Itâs one where they can also bring up and test all kinds of new <font color="red">PaaS</font> and <font color="red">application deployment</font> environments. Our number one <font color="red">use case</font> has been organizations that want to empower the dev test users with greater <font color="red">infrastructure automation</font>, self service and lab functionality.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  You said you spoke into a large number of folks who are previous or current <font color="red">VMware</font> users. Are you seeing the shift from folks who have a big spend at Amazon, and if so, what is that breaking point financially? What is that breaking point where itâs actually going to make more sense to move your Amazon <font color="red">workloads</font> to something like a private <font color="red">OpenStack</font> environment?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We do have customers from both segments, people who have large <font color="red">VMware</font> deployments, and are looking to use <font color="red">OpenStack</font> on top of it. People who are maybe saying, look, we have <font color="red">VMware</font> and itâs great for production, but maybe we want to use KVM for test and dev. We also have customers who have scaled up on Amazon, but are now looking to bring it in-house because of the â¦ they know their <font color="red">workload</font> characterization and knowing that they think they can run it a lot more efficiently on their own infrastructure. I would say itâs a mix of everything.</p>
<p>Going back to your question about Amazon, our customers seem to have a typical point about $150K per month. Itâs about $2 million a year. Itâs where they really start to think about that spending very carefully. Itâs not a very large sample size, Iâm talking about maybe seven to eight customers there, it maybe a little more variable than that. The key thing is that if we make it â¦ if <font color="red">OpenStack</font> were trivially simple that threshold should drop. People today hesitate to bring it in-house because they think of the complexity of running all of this. If we as a community make <font color="red">OpenStack</font> amazingly simple, 10X simple than it is today, then people would do it maybe earlier.</p>
<p>Itâs a pretty exciting time to be able to do that, because I think with Amazon, people understand what your <font color="red">cloud infrastructure</font> needs to look like and how to use it. Now, with <font color="red">OpenStack</font> you have a way to do that with your own internal infrastructure. Itâs up to us to make that really simple and easy and more accessible.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Are you seeing any folks that go the DIY route and ultimately either donât have a good experience or fail?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We have seen customers. Let me put it this way, I donât know if they consider themselves as having failed, but they have been trying for two years and they are about trying to rollout their <font color="red">OpenStack</font> environment. To me, itâs important to set egos aside and say, âLook, if your organization has spent two years trying to operationalize a <font color="blue">private cloud</font>; thatâs two years of opportunity that has been lost. You could have been using a <font color="blue">private cloud</font> for two years.â I think there are customers who will get that, and there are customers who want to try further themselves.</p>
<p>Itâs a lot of computer science fun to be able to try and configure <font color="red">OpenStack</font> and make it work at scale in production. In the end, again, I quote my favorite guru agent [inaudible 00:48:54] itâs undifferentiated lifting for a lot of companies out there. What you want to do is really use <font color="red">private clouds</font> to achieve greater agility in your core competency. If you are spending years or months, even months trying to do that then thatâs really undifferentiated lifting and youâre better off using a packaged solution.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Definitely see how you can compare Metacloud now that Iâve talked to you more, to <font color="red">Platform9</font>, very similar drivers to creating these types of solutions for sure. Jeff, did you have a question, because I have another one?</p>
<p>Jeff:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I had one. I see this as a great easy access onboarding for a lot of companies. The talent pool is very shallow for <font color="red">OpenStack</font> engineers and every company wants <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. I am talking to all these companies. They want <font color="red">OpenStack</font>; they donât have the skill set to get going. They want it, and every time they donât make a decision they are behind like you are saying. Itâs Iâm going to see a great fit for you guys.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Itâs the opportunity cost really. Letâs assume that you are using Amazon or letâs assume you are using a static <font color="red">virtualization</font> environment, maybe a traditional <font color="red">VMware</font> environment. Or letâs assume you are trying to operationalize a modern <font color="red">OpenStack</font> environment, but itâs taking a lot longer. All three models there is an opportunity cost for you. And Amazon is actually the best option. If you have to choose one of these three you should maybe be on Amazon. Really you will hit a point where you realize that for your business, when your CFO or your management team looks at it, you want to have a better solution than that. Thatâs the opportunity for us in the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community to solve.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Who are your â¦ We are getting close to time here. You mentioned Randy Bias and Adrian Cockroftâ¦definitely two people that I certainly admire. Who are your mentors? Who do you admire in terms of your technology people that you look up to?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Iâd say Werner Vogels. He and the team and Amazon, theyâve done breathtaking work. It is mind blowing work they have achieved. Itâs something we should all be inspired by. Those guys built it. Then Adrian taught the worldâ¦ Netflix and Adrian taught the world how to use it, which is just as important.</p>
<p>I really admire Solomon Hykes. I think <font color="red">Docker</font> is gorgeous. Show a developer the <font color="red">Docker</font> workflow, and show me a developer who doesnât like it. Itâs achieved that infrastructure as code failed to â¦ application <font color="red">container</font> with virtual machines never really were able to achieve. It is a lot of people â¦ ding <font color="red">Docker</font> a lot, saying, <font color="red">containers</font> have been around for ever and mostly unique IP, itâs just packaging. But I think that packaging is brilliant. It makes the technology so accessible and pleasurable to use. There are some of the people that I admire. I admire my co-founding team. These are people that I am really fortunate to work with. Those are some.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Do you want to name their names, so you can give them a little shout out here?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah, absolutely. Look, I started with Bick Lee. Bick is my mentor. He was my mentor when I started at <font color="red">VMware</font>. When I was making all kinds of â¦ My first code review is through [inaudible 00:52:28], Iâll tell you. Iâll remember them for the rest of my life. He is our chief architect. Madhura Maskasky, you should feature her some time. I donât think there is a lot of women like her in technology. She is VP of Product and she has got incredible design sense and she has a lot of passion for what she does at work.</p>
<p>Roopak is one of the most understated people that I know. I had the opportunity to work with him seven years, and the guy is just an idea machine. He looks at things and he comes up with all these crazy ideas, and he then has the ability to build it. This whole <font color="red">OpenStack</font> <font color="red">control plane</font> was his idea. You can look at it, we now actually have built it and we have over 50 customers actually using it, which are up to these three.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  That kind of dovetails into some of our â¦ By the way weâd love to have her â¦ Madhura, is that how you say her name?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We love to have Madhura on the podcast. That would be excellent. Any time I get a chance to feature women in tech is a super awesome day for me. Weâve had Jessica Murillo. I donât know how to pronounce it, but she was definitely stellar. Where can people find you on social media or what can be there more about your stuff?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  They can obviously go to the website Platform9.com. They can follow us at Platform9Sys. We are starting to host a lot more meetups if you are in the bay area. We are hosting bayLISA. We did one last month and we might be hosting the next one as well; follow us on twitter and youâll see it: @Platform9Sys or on our website at Platform9.com.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Awesome. Two people that you would love to see on the show, obviously, you already said Madhura, who else?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I would nominate Madhura Maskasky, my co-founder. I would also see if you could get Solomon Hykes and ask him for his perspective on enterprise infrastructure and <font color="red">containers</font> and <font color="red">OpenStack</font>.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Awesome. We find a lot of request for <font color="red">Docker</font>. I keep putting it out there on Twitter. I donât know if Ben and Nick [inaudible 00:54:33] are watching. We would love to have some folks from <font color="red">Docker</font> on, I am just saying.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Those guys are awesome. Itâs very disciplined technology, and itâs something that has to play better with <font color="red">OpenStack</font>.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  For sure. Any closing words for folks out there with one minute left to spare?</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Iâd say thank you Niki and Jeff for having me and being such gracious hosts. For everyone who sat through VR, thank you so much for taking your time to listen in. I hope you found this useful and interesting, and I look forward to hearing from you at <font color="red">Platform9</font>.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We look forward to seeing you in a cowboy hat and cowboy boots.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Next time Iâm in Texas.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Awesome.</p>
<p>Jeff:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Well, thanks everybody for watching the show today. Jeff, who do we have next week. I do this every week.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I am never ready for this question. I donât know why. Give me one second here to pull that up.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Is it Ryan Floyd? Do you see that?</p>
<p>Jeff:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  It is absolutely no one. There is a hole in next week. Weâve got everything lined up, so weâve got Ryan Floyd coming up and Chris Kemp coming up, but I need to figure out next week.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  No pressure. Iâll get right on that.</p>
<p>Jeff:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Awesome. Well, again, thank you so much for joining as â¦ definitely looking forward to seeing <font color="red">Platform9</font> at the summit in Vancouver. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us. We really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Sirish:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Great seeing you.</p>
<p>Niki:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  All right. Everybody have a good day. Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Jeff:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Bye.</p>
