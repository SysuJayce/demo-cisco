<p>Niki Acosta:               Hi Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                Good morning everyone. I&#8217;m Jeff Dickey from Redapt.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Jeff&#8217;s computer is slightly delayed it seems like, but the show must go on. This is Niki Acosta with <font color="red">Cisco</font>. I think what Jeff was trying to say is, &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Jeff Dickey from Redapt.&#8221; Right Jeff? We have an awesome guest with us today who has great internet, Ruchi Bhargava, introduce yourself.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Hi, I&#8217;m Ruchi. I work for <font color="red">Intel</font>. I&#8217;ve been working there since 1991, and I&#8217;m glad to be here, Niki and Jeff.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               We&#8217;re are so glad to have you. It&#8217;s always a special day for me when we get to interview women in the tech industry, so super stoked to have you, and we typically start out the show by letting you tell us your journey through tech up until what you do now at <font color="red">Intel</font>.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Wow. That can be long, but I&#8217;ll try to make it short. I grew up in India. I have two elder brothers who are engineers. Typically, my mom never said that that girls should be doctors, but she says, &#8220;Oh, I wish one of my kids was a doctor&#8221; and that kind of &#8230; In those teenage years, your rebellious behavior comes onboard, and I said you know what, &#8220;I think you&#8217;re just saying this for me because I&#8217;m a girl and I want to be an engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure enough, maybe she was right. I may have made a better doctor, but I went into engineering school, did an electrical engineering undergraduate degree, and I thought I was going to be a power engineer till I did my internship in the junior year. Guess what? The guy who went with me from school was placed on the shop floor doing switch gear and I was put into the backrooms of the computer <font color="red">data center</font> or the computer room. It was really not a <font color="red">data center</font>.</p>
<p>Writing reports, there were no spreadsheets at that time, I&#8217;m dating myself, but I had to create reports. And I may not have learned much about computer science in that internship, but I definitely learned one thing: that I think computer science is the field for me, so that got me focused on looking…</p>
<p>I thought I would go to grad school, get a degree in computer science, but then I got a job offer with an OEM manufacturer in India, and at that time they were the Unix wave, mini-computers wave was on. They basically used to sell computers to enterprises and large organizations and also sell the services of software engineers, so I was one of those field application engineers.</p>
<p>My first job, first project which I think I learned the most so far on both in terms of computer science as well as people skills, etc., was to develop a payroll system for 70,000 employees of a government organization. I think things which you learn to deploy something like that at scale was just brilliant, and that&#8217;s what got me into technology.</p>
<p>Then, I joined <font color="red">Intel</font> in ‘91 doing factory automation software, which was more to run the <font color="red">Intel</font> fabs, but develop statistical process control which was in-line so that you could make decision on material whether it was of good quality or not.</p>
<p>In those days, there was no <font color="red">cloud</font>. People had to wait forever for a development and test systems, so that&#8217;s when I got into infrastructure a little bit. I was more of a databases person, but being part of the middleware team I had to work hand in glove with the people who set up the infrastructure and how to optimize the database is working well, working with the middleware, the message bus and stuff.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where I first got into infrastructure and then I moved around a lot at <font color="red">Intel</font> both in location. I lived in all places beginning with P, Phoenix, Portland, Penang, Malaysia. That&#8217;s one good thing about <font color="red">Intel</font>. You get to learn. If you get bored with one job, you can definitely go and be extremely successful with another job as if you were applying to another company.</p>
<p>I got really diverse experiences in the field of information technology both from infrastructure to application software to operations. When I came back to the United States in 2011, I don&#8217;t know if you know Das Kamhout was the architect of the open <font color="red">cloud</font> program which he was driving, and they needed somebody to drive the execution for that and that&#8217;s when I joined him. For the last two years till November, I was part of that team, leading the <font color="red">deployment</font> of <font color="red">OpenStack</font> based <font color="red">cloud</font>, <font color="blue">private cloud</font> for us.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Have you seen Das&#8217; band play? That&#8217;s the question.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Yes, I did.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Yeah?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Yes.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Awesome.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Yeah.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Take us back a little bit because I definitely just out of my own curiosity, how was your upbringing in terms of getting technical skills? How was that different in India than it is in the United States? I know it&#8217;s been a while since you&#8217;ve been in school, but just out of my own curiosity.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       At that time, there was nothing like a science fair or it was all about whatever you could do yourself. I grew up in lot of cities in India, and I did my high school in the city called Bombay, which is fairly large metro city. They used to do what they called aptitude tests in eighth grade, ninth grade, and tenth grade, which helped kids go and determine which field you wanted to go into.</p>
<p>I always came out with &#8230; You&#8217;ll be going into doing something technical, technology focus. I was known at home and in my friends; there is this term called jugaad, which is in Hindi it basically means to make it work. You know if something broke down, I will never read a manual, but I&#8217;ll just &#8230; I won&#8217;t even open out things but I&#8217;ll press a lot of buttons to make things work.</p>
<p>My family always thought she will just make it work. At work too, I may not have the right technical answer, but I kind of always find out. I can break something and then try to fix it back.</p>
<p>Personally, that was what &#8230; I don&#8217;t think that was what you were asking. You were asking more about how do they guide students into technology, right. Now, from what I hear, there is the same kind of initiatives like the science fairs, the talent searches, science talent searches, which are also happening in India.</p>
<p>I spent some time in Malaysia where my kids grew up and did high school, same thing there. I think the STEM initiative. It&#8217;s not as rooted as it is in the United States, but it&#8217;s definitely getting up there.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               When you go through these sort of aptitude tests, do you have even option to say like, &#8220;Yeah, that test is not accurate. I don&#8217;t want to do that,&#8221; and completely switch directions or is it kind of not useful?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s basically &#8230; Yeah, lot of people will do what their parents tell them to do because of those stereotypes. If you&#8217;re a daughter, you are a doctor. If you&#8217;re son, you can do pretty much anything, but I think those times have changed.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Sure. Growing up as a woman in tech, I&#8217;m assuming just like anywhere else that you were probably a minority there. What is that being like for you?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Fortunately, it never felt like a minority. I went to an engineering school in Delhi, Delhi University, and the years prior to us there were like two girls in every batch, and the batch which I joined out of the 260, there were like 30 to 40 girls and that was a lot. I mean that really felt a lot, even though by percentage it is not that much.</p>
<p>We had a group of friends. All the girls generally hung out together and then they were certain &#8230; Of course, we had guys as part of our group, but generally it never felt that way. I&#8217;m thinking that was a movement which was going across the country, and so when I joined the workplace, I never felt that.</p>
<p>Even at <font color="red">Intel</font>, I don&#8217;t feel that we are a minority. There are certain groups. I have been in certain organizations where I&#8217;m the only woman on the team, but once you get that part off your head, I think it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               What do you think of all this lean-in stuff?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Lean-in is important. You lean in on everybody. The guys have to lean in too I think, but there is some hard facts about <font color="red">data</font>. There is some hard <font color="red">data</font> there that as women progress through their careers, they tend to drop off, especially at senior grade levels in any company you&#8217;ll see fewer women. That&#8217;s something as my daughter who is a high school senior right now, she says, &#8220;Hey, we have to smash the patriarchy.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you first hear it, you&#8217;ll say what you&#8217;re saying. She says, you &#8230; In order for the balance at the senior levels to be equal, initially you have to tilt it towards the other direction where men might feel that they are being undermined that they are not getting equal rights but it&#8217;s basically to keep the balance, and then once the balance has been tilted slightly towards women, ultimately it&#8217;ll balance and make it equal. I think it is more driven towards equality rather than lean-in towards the women&#8217;s rights.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Great perspective. Fascinating.</p>
<p>Jeff, I know your WiFi is less than spectacular, and sounds like you had a good night and a good morning; however, I&#8217;d like to see if you have any questions to my wonderful co-host.</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                I&#8217;d like to &#8230; Can you hear me okay?</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Yes.</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                Okay. I&#8217;d like to hear more about kind of what your involvement was with <font color="red">Intel</font>&#8217;s large <font color="red">OpenStack</font> <font color="red">deployment</font> and some of the issues you guys have had and overcome.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Wonderful. I joined the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> or the <font color="blue">private cloud</font> team in 2012, and at that time, the team was starting off with their first external focused &#8230; I mean it was an internal <font color="red">cloud</font>, but for our services business which was exposing those applications to it on the internet rather than just the intranet. The reason why we were targeting on that <font color="red">use case</font> was not so much on the enterprise <font color="red">use case</font> was because they were supposed to be designed for failure and perfect applications for <font color="red">cloud</font> <font color="red">deployment</font>.</p>
<p>However, it turned out that the business needs were more that they needed to be located at different locations where we couldn&#8217;t service, and the business model itself didn&#8217;t work out, so we actually lost that customer within <font color="red">Intel</font>.</p>
<p>Since we had made that investment and things were working good, we said okay, let&#8217;s put to test the enterprise <font color="red">use case</font>, and that&#8217;s where I think the largest amount of learnings came in. And as you probably are hearing, we have a huge investment as most of the enterprises on virtualization and on <font color="red">VMware</font>, right, so there is a lot of ESX underlying investments which have been made over the period of years and where we had about 20,000 <font color="red">VMs</font> running on that.</p>
<p>Now if I have to &#8230; Either I do a greenfield <font color="red">deployment</font> which is using <font color="red">OpenStack</font> and only put certain <font color="red">use cases</font> or I integrate everything, so our strategy was to put a <font color="red">control plane</font> which was on top of existing infrastructure which will orchestrate the existing infrastructure as well as deploy any new instances; whether it be using <font color="red">VMware</font> or using any greenfield products.</p>
<p>I think what you&#8217;re seeing now in the marketplace there are several products which are basically doing just the same, but at that time, there was nothing available, so it was a lot of DIY.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               What technologies are you using to do that? That&#8217;s fascinating by the way.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       We are using pretty much pure <font color="red">OpenStack</font>.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               You have ESX as a <font color="red">hypervisor</font> within your <font color="red">OpenStack</font> <font color="red">control plane</font>?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Right.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Then, do you have any sort of like policies that dictate where your instances get deployed, like how do you make the determination if it goes to an ESX <font color="red">hypervisor</font> or <font color="red">KVM</font> <font color="red">hypervisor</font> for example?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Our <font color="red">KVM</font> <font color="red">hypervisor</font> situation &#8230; The roadmap says we will have those policies. Today, we don&#8217;t have those deployed. We have a separate instance where we are deploying it to <font color="red">KVM</font> and there is separate instance where we&#8217;re deploying it to ESX which basically goes into the <font color="red">vCenter</font>. <font color="red">vCenter</font> manages after that. Ultimately, the goal for the IT team was before I left was depending on what the customer needs in terms of if there is a latency requirement, if there is what kind of images that they need and location, we&#8217;ll basically go and provision in the right underlying infrastructure. The customer doesn&#8217;t really care whether it&#8217;s ESX or <font color="red">KVM</font> or Xen or a <font color="red">container</font>.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Are you finding it easy to help transition people who are traditionally <font color="red">VMware</font> users to <font color="red">OpenStack</font>? How are you kind of bridging that gap from sort of one technology set to another inside of <font color="red">Intel</font>?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I think that was a huge challenge, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s a challenge for everybody. Because when people started using <font color="red">VMware</font>, prior to that a lot of people were just using &#8230; At <font color="red">Intel</font>, we still use in our design, where the <font color="red">silicon</font> design teams they use a <font color="red">Grid</font> and that&#8217;s very DevOps focused, that&#8217;s very automation focused.</p>
<p>Then when you use <font color="red">VMware</font>, <font color="red">VMware</font> does a lot of it for you, but it also provides a pretty GUI. We&#8217;ll then put together a front end for it which took us a long time, when did we start doing our <font color="red">VMware</font> journey, so it took us a long time to get to the place where our operations team was much more GUI focused. It was not automation focused.</p>
<p>Getting them to move towards &#8230; When we move to <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, required us to re-skill a whole lot of people from an operations perspective and also changed their mindset because it&#8217;s very easy to go away from the automation focus to click button and then choose things and somebody else does it for you.</p>
<p>Very common example which we use internally was if the hard disk gets filled up, every night or every three weeks an operations person will get up, they&#8217;ll do the clean up and then go back to sleep instead of automating that solution, right.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the behavior which we have been trying to change. We&#8217;ve been fairly successful, but I think every enterprise who is using <font color="red">VMware</font> will probably or something similar will have to migrate away from that mindset.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               What is your automation tool or configuration management tool of choice? Have you guys picked one or are you using multiple?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Well, it&#8217;s again historical. People initially in the <font color="red">Grid</font>, we were using something homegrown and then they used CFEngine, and then when we started with the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> effort, we were using Puppet not because it was the best or anything but that was something which we just picked.</p>
<p>We did look at over the period of time in different teams who were also looking Chef, Ansible, and also at CFEngine, so a combination thereof.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Yeah, certainly I&#8217;ve seen that large scale teams especially when I was at Rackspace use everything. I mean depending on what component of the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/solutions/trends/cloud/build-public-cloud.html" title="<font color="blue">public cloud</font>" target="_blank" class="seoal-link">public cloud</a> they were working on they certainly had some strong opinions on those. As far as the re-skilling people, how are you re-skilling people? Is it training? Is it just doing it? Is it hiring people? Is it all the above, none of the above?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       All of the above. Within IT operations, it&#8217;s a huge outfit. Everybody I think went through Linux training, everybody went through Puppet. A lot of those operations also went with Puppet training. Everybody went through <font color="red">OpenStack</font> training. They all have been through <font color="red">VMware</font> training and they are learning. Now, they also are being exposed to, how do you design an operate cloud-aware applications.</p>
<p>Then, we drive a lot of <font color="red">hackathons</font> within the company, within the IT organization where if you go through the training and don&#8217;t use it, that&#8217;s not going to be of any worth. Having those <font color="red">hackathons</font> has definitely helped the organization.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Real life <font color="red">use cases</font>, hands-on experience, budding up with people who know what they&#8217;re doing kind of thing?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       That&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               That&#8217;s good. I think there is a lot of people out there that are trying to figure out how they make that transition, especially looking at <font color="red">VMware</font> over to <font color="red">OpenStack</font> just because the technologies are so fundamentally different the way that you architect and scale applications.</p>
<p>Jeff, you have any questions?</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                Yeah, I want to hear more about what you&#8217;re doing now. Like what the group’s doing and what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I moved away from the group after we deployed the product instance of the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> <font color="red">control plane</font> orchestrating the <font color="red">VMware</font> infrastructure. I have now joined the <font color="red">Open Source Technology</font> Center which is within the software services group at <font color="red">Intel</font>, and what that group does as I was telling earlier, it&#8217;s a 1200-people organization and has been traditionally focused on Linux. When they first started when they were very small, <font color="red">Intel</font> was very contributing at noise levels on Linux. Now, it&#8217;s one of the largest contributors to Linux.</p>
<p>Our goal in that space was mainly to drive <font color="red">Intel</font> so that to ensure that Linux runs best on <font color="red">Intel</font> architecture. Now, that is I guess at a lower level in the stack, but from an <font color="red">OpenStack</font> perspective or in the <font color="blue">private cloud</font> perspective, our goal is to drive higher levels of adoption in the <font color="blue">private cloud</font>, be it <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, be it <font color="red">VMware</font>, be it Microsoft as well as so that people who are &#8230; because <font color="blue">public cloud</font> is not for everybody. There are requirements for security and some people from cost perspective or existing investments perspective that they&#8217;ll still be in <font color="blue">private cloud</font> scenario.</p>
<p>We have started growing our <font color="red">OpenStack</font> team, <font color="red">cloud</font> software engineering team. I have been growing for the last two months and I know will be doing so in the near future. Our focus has been multifold. One of them is to help meet the needs of the Win The Enterprise efforts of the Foundation.</p>
<p>A lot of the inputs have come from shops like the <font color="red">Intel</font> IT shops and several other members of the Win the Enterprise initiative and things like live migration work, having HA at scale for all the services. Those are standard things which are still not there, the problems of which every enterprise faces; How do you upgrade from one release to the other with zero downtime to existing tenants?</p>
<p>Those are things which we know are problems, and those are the problems which my team has been working on.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               How do you determine what <font color="red">Intel</font> contributes back and what sort of <font color="red">Intel</font> keeps as secret sauce? Is there anything [inaudible 00:21:25]?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       We don&#8217;t have any secret sauce in this. My group does everything upstream.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               That&#8217;s great. Are you finding it easy to contribute back up through <font color="red">OpenStack</font>? What is that process like for <font color="red">Intel</font>?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       That&#8217;s definitely has been a struggle for, especially when you hire people who are developers and not existing cores or existing <font color="red">PTLs</font>. To get that influence into the community, one takes time as well as the second part is the review process.</p>
<p>Every now and then I say, &#8220;Oh my patch or my proposal just got blocked because there are so many other important things which they have to work on.&#8221; I think that that is one of the focus areas which the community needs to start looking at how to do differently.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Are you finding it difficult to wield influence inside of <font color="red">OpenStack</font> given that <font color="red">Intel</font>&#8217;s focus is probably a little bit lower in the stack?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I don&#8217;t think so. That&#8217;s not because of the why. I think it&#8217;s also &#8230; When I&#8217;ll do the analysis, it&#8217;s also a matter of numbers; how many people you have in which team. If you have a lot of people focusing on the same, say for example the top three or four companies are HP, Red Hat, Mirantis, IBM, Rackspace; If you look at this, then you can easily correlate the number of people who are there in each of these teams working on it. That&#8217;s the number of amount of influence.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve started growing, but we&#8217;re growing in a very focused manner with the focus on Win the Enterprise and Win the Telco so that there is more adoption. The goal is to drive higher adoption for <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, and by doing that we don&#8217;t have a solution to sell, so that probably gets us little leeway with the community because we get a lot more support than probably some other vendors if they are proposing something.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Yeah. Definitely, definitely see that. I was doing a write up for this woman in <font color="red">OpenStack</font> Open Mic Series, and one of the questions is which <font color="red">OpenStack</font> debate gets you most fired up?</p>
<p>I think there is a lot of companies. <font color="red">Intel</font> is probably an exception just because as a company you guys have been contributing to Linux for some time, but I think larger companies who have built businesses from intellectual property probably find it a little bit difficult to shift their thinking into this <font color="red">open source</font> model way of doing things and trying to figure out how you monetize, where you monetize, where in the stack you add value, how to be a good community member, how you deal with coopetition. Those are definitely things that I think a lot of companies are struggling with now.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Right. We are definitely &#8230; A lot of our team members across the globe are driving a lot of community efforts. For example, I&#8217;ve got a team in China. They&#8217;re doing a meetup in Shanghai next week for all of <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. It&#8217;s not just focused on a particular project, and I think a lot of attention been given to operations and even the enterprise at the operator summit which is happening this week in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>I think with that kind of focus and fairly neutral focus on driving up where the focus is on driving up the adoption of <font color="red">OpenStack</font> rather than selling a particular product, I think that helps a whole lot.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Somebody says to you why <font color="red">Intel</font> for my <font color="red">OpenStack</font> <font color="red">deployment</font>, how do you answer that?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       It&#8217;s not why &#8230; When you say why <font color="red">Intel</font>, are you talking about <font color="red">Intel</font> architect in terms of <font color="red">silicon</font>?</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Yes.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       There are certain &#8230; We don&#8217;t have a distribution of <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, so there is no <font color="red">Intel</font> software distribution. Whatever we contribute goes straight to each of the projects within <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, so it will be there in Red Hat’s, it will be there in HP’s, or any other distribution.</p>
<p>If you want a architecture, definitely what we&#8217;re trying to do is &#8230; There are several features of <font color="red">Intel</font> architecture, <font color="red">Intel</font> <font color="red">silicon</font>, which we also expose through <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. For example, PCI, SR-IOV, some network optimization features which if you deploy on <font color="red">Intel</font> architecture, <font color="red">Intel</font> servers, then whether you use any vendors <font color="red">OpenStack</font> distribution, you should be able to consume that and expose those.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               That&#8217;s great. It probably has much more mass appeal than some other solutions.</p>
<p>Jeff, you like you want to say something.</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                Yeah, you were talking about kind of the accelerating adoption. What are the big things kind of keeping people from adopting <font color="red">OpenStack</font>?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Again, those same three things right. One is operations at scale; things like Live Migration, things which <font color="red">VMware</font> has historically provided a lot of great capabilities in the ecosystem. There is this thing called Evacuate on host failure where you &#8230; There is no such thing which is working today. People can make it work by workarounds or by providing glue, but it&#8217;s not automatic in <font color="red">OpenStack</font> as yet. It&#8217;s not a priority right now because people want a stable system right now, right, so that is one aspect of it.</p>
<p>Second is HA of services. Like for example, if you deploy collections using Heat, Heat itself is not resilient and there are several other Heat. If Heat service becomes HA, then it&#8217;s going to be a great thing for the enterprise.</p>
<p>Then, of course the third part is lot of times people have that myth and rightly so it was the situation earlier that <font color="red">OpenStack</font> is one not mature. You really need to have a large IT organization to deploy <font color="red">OpenStack</font> and all that was fairly true earlier, but now with all these solutions which a lot of vendors are providing where you can have a <font color="red">control plane</font> which will orchestrate existing infrastructure with a new infrastructure, things are I think beginning to shape up really well for <font color="red">OpenStack</font>.</p>
<p>Whether it is you&#8217;re deploying <font color="red">containers</font> or you&#8217;re deploying <font color="red">VMware</font> or ESX <font color="red">hypervisors</font> or <font color="red">KVM</font>, I think even if you look at all your <font color="red">podcast</font> recently, there have been several solutions in the marketplace which will meet those needs. I think the future is bright.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               What are <font color="red">containers</font>? It seems like every show what we host ultimately <font color="red">containers</font> becoming a topic of discussion. In fact, noting on some of the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> submissions, it look like there were quite a few talks about <font color="red">containers</font> just in general. Where do you see the future of <font color="red">containers</font> and how is that going to change people&#8217;s ideas and methodologies in how they deploy and migrate applications?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       First of all, I&#8217;d like to quantify that I&#8217;m not an expert on <font color="red">containers</font>, and second from what I have learned of late it definitely provides a lot more, <font color="red">VMs</font> come with little more overhead than <font color="red">containers</font>.</p>
<p>If I have to deploy 200 <font color="red">containers</font> and 200 <font color="red">VMs</font>, it&#8217;s much much more faster to go and deploy <font color="red">containers</font> today. Now, the other part is it also provides some sort of portability. Because within a <font color="red">container</font>, you don&#8217;t have any noisy neighbor issue.</p>
<p>Now, the third part which people don&#8217;t &#8230; I think and I&#8217;m not an expert as I said is the security feature. There are security constraints with <font color="red">containers</font> which <font color="red">VMs</font> provide, so definitely this is going to be a mix in the future.</p>
<p>From an enterprise <font color="red">use case</font>, I&#8217;m still not convinced that <font color="red">containers</font> can meet each and every <font color="red">use case</font>. Definitely in the web app space, definitely it is viable solution, but maybe in the enterprise <font color="red">use case</font>, it&#8217;s not quite there, but I&#8217;m sure there is somebody working on it.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Are you seeing a lot of these <font color="red">deployments</font>? Most of the <font color="red">deployments</font> that you&#8217;re learning about are they still primarily greenfield <font color="red">deployments</font> or we starting to see brownfield <font color="red">deployments</font> or attempts to convert applications from their traditional sort of states into a more cloudy state?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I think it&#8217;s a combination. A lot more. Even this within <font color="red">Intel</font>, <font color="red">Intel</font> IT and our customers, there is a lot more effort going towards any new applications when they develop them. They are doing more resilient application development, and there are definitely groups within <font color="red">Intel</font> who are hosting on <font color="red">Intel</font> <font color="red">cloud</font> who are developing resilient apps, but however there are 80% or 90% of the traditional enterprise apps. I don&#8217;t think we should force them to redevelop because let&#8217;s leverage the investment what has already been made. In doing that, there are things, tools which will help you <font color="red">cloud</font>ify the existing applications and deploy them in an cloud environment. I think that&#8217;s where on the application layer and lot of focus is going to be and should be.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               I agree. I definitely agree. I mean whoever can figure out how to take a traditional application and seamlessly convert it to make it cloudy, is going to be onto something I think.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       True. Business opportunity.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Jeff, you&#8217;re smiling.</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                Yeah, I totally agree. It&#8217;s just &#8230;</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Jeff is frozen.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       He&#8217;s unfrozen now.</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m frozen or not. Now, go ahead.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Now, you are. You&#8217;re there.</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                Okay.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Your picture blurs out a little bit and you go little radio silent. Okay, now you&#8217;re silent. Oh, that hotel WiFi. Good night. In terms of, you could probably speak to this. In <font color="red">Intel</font>, potentially before the show we were talking about some of the great programs that you&#8217;re running for high school students, how are you helping drive <font color="red">OpenStack</font> in those programs with high school students and potentially any other programs that you have relative to women in the space.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I&#8217;ll start with women in general. <font color="red">Intel</font> has been for many many years &#8230; When did they start WIN? WIN is Women at <font color="red">Intel</font> Network, and this was again focused on how to keep women at the workforce and how to get them to be more successful and enable them to be continuing to work as they progress through their careers at <font color="red">Intel</font>.</p>
<p>If you look at any of these surveys, great places to work, WIN always shows up as one of the reasons why <font color="red">Intel</font> has been successful in keeping women at work, and they don&#8217;t just do it during the International&#8217;s Women&#8217;s Day or Women&#8217;s Week&#8211;it&#8217;s a year-round effort.</p>
<p>Of late, our CEO has recently announced a huge amount of money that they&#8217;re going to focus on diversity in the workplace because not only is it good for our employees but it&#8217;s also good for our business so that whatever products which we design, whoever designs our products is also &#8230; because if you have only similar kind of people and I&#8217;m not saying only men, I&#8217;m saying it&#8217;s diversity in general.</p>
<p>If the same kind of people design our products, it&#8217;s going to be consumable only by the same kind of people, and so we want our designers, our product capabilities are how they are designed to be designed for diverse audience. That&#8217;s why there is this huge thrust on diversity and you&#8217;ll see a lot more in the press soon.</p>
<p>Now, as far as high school students and again <font color="red">Intel</font> has been &#8230; If you see <font color="red">Intel</font>&#8217;s Science Talent Search, <font color="red">Intel</font> Science and Engineering Fair, there always been a huge impetus on driving STEM education and getting it more and encouraging more students to do it.</p>
<p>Now, even at the grassroots level, we offer internships, apprenticeships to high school students, and one of those which I was telling Niki earlier was, we&#8217;re going to be getting eight students here in Oregon who will be focusing on <font color="red">OpenStack</font>. One of the things which they&#8217;ll be working on is get them exposure, and I think the lowest hanging fruit perhaps would be to have them participate in Bugathons or drive them and get them to work on those. I&#8217;m really looking forward to that, and I think we&#8217;ll have them in June-July time frame.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               How do you put out &#8230; What are you looking for and how do you get the word out for those that might be interested in doing the same to high school students?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I&#8217;m sure every city or if they don&#8217;t have it, like here in Oregon we have this thing called Saturday Academy which holds apprenticeships in science and engineering, they have this initiative. They offer, they work with the different companies. I know IBM does it in their Linux Technology Center. There are the universities here, research organizations, and <font color="red">Intel</font> has just recently joined them where we offer internships to high school students. Now, that&#8217;s one option.</p>
<p>I also know <font color="red">Intel</font> sponsors a lot of student <font color="red">hackathons</font>. There was one last year where it wasn&#8217;t focused on <font color="red">OpenStack</font> but it was focused on software development in general and it landed up being more of web app development because it&#8217;s a 24 hour or a day long initiative where high school students will come in, and they didn&#8217;t need to have any experience. That&#8217;s the beauty of it that you can take somebody who has zero experience developing applications, and at the end of the day, they come up with some sort of an application.</p>
<p>There are national organizations I know who are &#8230; You just Google high school <font color="red">hackathons</font> and there&#8217;ll be tons of recommendations you&#8217;ll get. If you&#8217;re talking globally, I always tend not to be focused very much on the United States only, so when we look at our audience across the different countries, I know there are several initiatives, and if they don&#8217;t have it, it&#8217;s never too late to sponsor one for your community. Just reach out to the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community, and people should be able to help.</p>
<p>For example, not only for students, our goal is from improvement in the community, how to you get more reviews, more approvals faster. One of things which we thought may be to do a <font color="red">hackathon</font> just before the release cycle ends. We&#8217;re hoping that we&#8217;ll be able to get this going in BRC, and I would be really happy if you can get some of the cores to either fly out there or be there on the phone available to do the reviews which people participating in those <font color="red">hackathons</font> are.</p>
<p>If you can do that across the globe, have one day efforts or two-day initiatives, it might accelerate some of the execution.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               That&#8217;s so cool that that <font color="red">Intel</font> is doing that, and you personally it sounds like you are pretty invested in your community. You mentioned earlier that you have a daughter. What do you want for your daughter? Are you encouraging her to look at a STEM field and if so how are you convincing her to look into that when social pressures may dictate that it&#8217;s not a cool thing to participate in?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I&#8217;ve got two daughters, and both of them when they were in their tweens said, &#8220;I am not going to become an engineer&#8221; because our whole family is into engineering. Ironically, the older one landed up doing a dual-degree program, and her degree is in biomedical engineering. I never told her to do engineering at all. The younger one is now focused on getting a computer science degree. I definitely want her to do what she feels that she is going to be happy with, so she wants to do computer science and art combination. Let&#8217;s see where she lands up.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               That&#8217;s so cool. How much do you think is nature versus nurture? Like do you think that engineers are born with something that&#8217;s maybe a little different than everybody else or do you think that it&#8217;s a factor of your upbringing and your education.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I think it&#8217;s a matter of upbringing and education. It&#8217;s very little is just nature. The more you expose people to it, the more you show them what they can aspire to be is what they will end up becoming.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               I know.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       May be it&#8217;s just my belief. I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Maybe I need to pull my son away from his iPad. He is like addicted to video games, which so push him into tech at some point may not be a bad idea, but you know I&#8217;ll support him whatever he wants to do.</p>
<p>What else can we talk about? We talked about tribal thinking a little bit. What are you excited about in the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> community or just tech in general? What gets you pumped?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I think from <font color="red">OpenStack</font> &#8230; Let&#8217;s talk about <font color="red">OpenStack</font> first. I get very diverse views about <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, and maybe that&#8217;s something which all three of us can talk about it, right. A lot of times I hear oh <font color="red">OpenStack</font> is dead. Then, I go to an <font color="red">OpenStack</font> Summit and see like thousands of people there. Then, I also see Walmart deploying &#8230; Like how many cores did they deploy? 10,000 cores or &#8230;?</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               100,000 cores.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       100,000 cores. Like, is that dead? I mean an operation of that scale, and then we see ourselves doing. One of the things when we first deployed in our pilot environment, it was declared to be a pilot environment for a development <font color="red">use case</font>. It was not supposed to be a production environment for anybody.</p>
<p>People as there is a fun phrase which we like to use at <font color="red">Intel</font> and say this is like free bananas. When you give free bananas, people just consume it. Whether they want to eat it or not, whether they will have any use for it, they&#8217;ll just pick one up and take it and that&#8217;s what happened and huge adoption.</p>
<p>We used to add capacity and it used to get consumed. Then, we had this production instance getting there and we said, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;re going to stop people from provisioning in this pilot environment.&#8221; I cannot tell you how many escalations I received, and &#8220;You cannot do this to us. We love it. You know, you can&#8217;t take it away from us,&#8221; and the self-service capability which people got as they didn&#8217;t need to go to Amazon, they didn&#8217;t need to swipe a credit card. They were just able to consume something right away, that was brilliant for them. They just did not want me to go and shut it down. I think that was so rewarding and yet it was challenging.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               I could just picture Oprah Winfrey like… You get a banana! You get a banana! You get a banana! I wouldn&#8217;t like to be on the other end of that phone call for sure&#8211;that escalation. I think that&#8217;s allure of <font color="red">OpenStack</font> though right is like, &#8220;Hey, you know give your people what they need when they need it.&#8221; You can set some limitations there, but set those limitations and trust them to get the job done.</p>
<p>Have you guys implemented storage at all within your <font color="red">OpenStack</font> environment or has it just primarily been complete resources?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       No, we have. We have storage and we have network, and storage has been a challenge. With <font color="red">KVM</font>, we had this distributed storage solution, which we realized it was financially not viable. I think maturity wise it&#8217;s getting there, but financially from a support model perspective it didn&#8217;t work out for us, at least when we looked at it last year. If the pricing becomes viable, then maybe enterprises would go for it.</p>
<p>For now, we&#8217;re using what we had with underlying investments as I write the <font color="red">OpenStack</font> <font color="red">control plane</font> deploying under with the SAN storage.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               With SAN underneath. What about <font color="red">Neutron</font>? Are you guys on <font color="red">Neutron</font>? Are you still using Nova-net?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       We are using <font color="red">Neutron</font>, and we are using… there’s an instance where we&#8217;re using Nova-network also, which we&#8217;re trying to get out of.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Wow. How has that transition been? We talked to a lot of people who were like, &#8220;Ah, we&#8217;ll get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       No. I think we&#8217;ll get there, but again those are the pilot environments where people don&#8217;t want to get off it. It&#8217;s not going to be a migration from there to another. It&#8217;s going to be just picking up the other instance and keeping it going, but of course <font color="red">Neutron</font> has its challenges too.</p>
<p>We have also people working in other initiatives around networking with ODL. <font color="red">Intel</font> is also participating in the open daylight board and the foundation as well as open <font color="red">NFV</font>. A lot of initiatives on the network space are also occurring.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Fascinating. What about new projects? Are there any new projects that are non-core projects that you guys are looking at?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I think there needs to be &#8230; It&#8217;s not driven out of <font color="red">Intel</font>, but you heard that Triple-O. HP is getting out of it. What does that mean for the rest of the community? There is definitely a need for a solution in that space and also how do we do upgrades? May be there is a instant upgrade utility where you can upgrade from one version to another provided you have this kind of component set where we have that upgrade configured for two or three different scenarios.</p>
<p>If something like that can be initiated out to the community, it would be a great option.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               What about things like Heat or Murano or some of the more application template functions?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       There are teams at <font color="red">Intel</font> who are definitely looking at it. <font color="red">Intel</font> IT team had been looking at Heat and Murano to do our complex collections initiative, and then we also have a <font color="red">PaaS</font> initiative, right, so there is a combination of all these three from an <font color="red">application deployment</font> perspective.</p>
<p>Then, there is also efforts with Heat in the <font color="red">data center</font> field. There is a group of people who are working on Heat there and how to make it more resilient.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               You mentioned <font color="red">PaaS</font>. Have you picked a <font color="red">PaaS</font> flavor of choice yet or you guys looking at doing something on your own?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       <font color="red">Intel</font> is fairly active in the <font color="red">Cloud</font> Foundry foundation. We&#8217;re again on the board there, and we&#8217;ve deployed <font color="red">Cloud</font> Foundry in our environment in the <font color="red">Intel</font> IT, and that&#8217;s definitely been one of the solutions.</p>
<p>As you know, at <font color="red">Intel</font> we just don&#8217;t fall behind at particular solution, so there are multiple options which people look at.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               That&#8217;s really cool. How lucky you guys are that you get to participate in all these different things and just try kind of anything you want. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Yeah, but there&#8217;s always that thing about money, right, so there&#8217;s only so much you can do.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Of course, of course. I think yet another reason why <font color="red">OpenStack</font> has become popular choice amongst everything from large enterprises to hobbyist right is that the model definitely offers some relief from licensing fees associated with other technology sets.</p>
<p>Have you guys looked at all at the <font color="red">VMware</font> integrated <font color="red">OpenStack</font> solution?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       It got announced after I left IT. I&#8217;m sure IT is looking at it as one of the &#8230; When we started, it was a DIY shop, right. At that time, there was no solutions available. Now, it&#8217;s not only <font color="red">VMware</font> who has the solution similar, I know others have similar solutions available.</p>
<p>I think the last week&#8217;s <font color="red">podcast</font> was Platform9.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Yes.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       It sounded interesting. It sounded very similar, right, but little more options to it I think.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of other solution vendors who will have similar solutions. I know that <font color="red">Intel</font> IT and many other enterprise IT shops should probably be doing requests for codes and stuff in the space and comparisons to see what works well for them.</p>
<p>I think every situation is going to be different depending on what the existing infrastructure is, how do you integrate with your existing infrastructure. That&#8217;s because with all the investments which people make in the current <font color="red">data center</font> solutions, that integration is very very important.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Do you have customers now asking you for validated architecture specifically for <font color="red">OpenStack</font> or is it still just kind of here and there?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Remember, we don&#8217;t sell a solution, right. <font color="red">Intel</font> doesn&#8217;t sell the solution, but <font color="red">Intel</font> is definitely partnering with OSVs in putting reference implementations which work best with <font color="red">Intel</font> architecture so that when the different OSVs go and sell their distributions we have them validated on <font color="red">Intel</font> architecture.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when we hear about what are constraints with <font color="red">OpenStack</font>, what are for enterprise shops to get or Telco shops to go and deploy <font color="red">OpenStack</font> at scale. That operation scale is what is going to be key.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Sure.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Because I think for dev/test environments, it&#8217;s just perfect. I think it&#8217;s 100% ready. It&#8217;s for production operations at scale is where the challenges come in and the community needs to muster up some comment, support and do it.</p>
<p>I think what is happening is everybody is doing a lot of their secret sauces but think about it. If all these secret sauces were combined together and contributed upstream, initially that may not be a lot of gain to those OSVs, but if there&#8217;s adoption, then there will be more innovation which could be the secret sauce.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Yeah, most definitely and you&#8217;re seeing &#8230; I mean it&#8217;s amazing how creating <font color="red">OpenStack</font> as an <font color="red">open source project</font> has sort of changed the technology landscape as a whole. I mean you saw people come out soon after and just start <font color="red">open sourcing</font> things, which is great. I mean I wish we had the same. At some level, maybe we do, but I wish we had that same type of thinking around things like medical research and trying to help solve problems on a global scale. I think &#8230;</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Very, very true.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               It&#8217;d be great to share those ideas. We are nearing the end of our show. We typically like to ask you how can people find you online?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Okay. I&#8217;m on Twitter. I think it&#8217;s Ruchi Bhargav, ruchi_bhargava, and I&#8217;m also &#8230; I don&#8217;t go onto IRC that often but I should start going. The only IRC channels I used to subscribe to was my teams, <font color="red">Intel</font> IT teams, but I should start going more on that and then on LinkedIn. Fairly active on the Women of <font color="red">OpenStack</font> team, and there&#8217;s a LinkedIn group there and so I&#8217;m there online.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               We can find you in Vancouver, I’m assuming. Yes?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Yes. I will be there.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               I know. I&#8217;m so excited about Vancouver. It&#8217;s going to be great and then Tokyo afterwards. Last question of the show. Who else should we have on the show?</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I was thinking about that because I&#8217;ve seen some of your <font color="red">podcasts</font>. I think maybe &#8230; I have lots of thoughts. I&#8217;m very bad with names, but maybe once have one session where you get few <font color="red">PTLs</font>, may be for the Nova <font color="red">PTL</font> and the <font color="red">Neutron</font> <font color="red">PTL</font> and have an operator be there.</p>
<p>Then, maybe with all this focus on <font color="red">Docker</font>, get the <font color="red">Docker</font> engineering lead or a product manager at <font color="red">Docker</font> along with somebody in the enterprise who has tried deploying <font color="red">Docker</font>, so those might be good options.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Common theme we&#8217;re hearing for sure. Those <font color="red">Docker</font> folks must be really busy. Jeff, have we reached out to <font color="red">Docker</font> personally? Do we need to do that?</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                I can&#8217;t remember. I think so.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               <font color="red">PTL</font> is a great idea. We should absolutely have some <font color="red">PTLs</font>. I think we had &#8230; We&#8217;ve had former <font color="red">PTLs</font>, but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve had active <font color="red">PTLs</font>.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Talk to them about how can they improve the review process. Maybe get the couple of <font color="red">PTLs</font> with the few people from the TC and focus on that. Another area which I think would be good to talk about is Big Tent. I personally think Big Tent right now &#8230; I think it&#8217;s going to be a huge challenge. It&#8217;ll dilute the importance of <font color="red">OpenStack</font> as a brand. As it is, we can&#8217;t get &#8230; We need people to focus on stability in a particular service and a project, and if we keep adding more projects, I am not sure if that&#8217;s the best way to get the stability and adoption going.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Great. Well, thank you so much, so much, so much for joining us today. It was an absolute pleasure talking to you. Thank you for all you do for women in tech at all levels within <font color="red">Intel</font>, outside of <font color="red">Intel</font>, with high schoolers. Really cool stuff that you&#8217;re doing and definitely someone to be admired.</p>
<p>I hope if we have men out there that are watching this show today and you&#8217;ve got daughters that you&#8217;d like to inspire, then you play this <font color="red">podcast</font> for them. That would be my hope for our viewers out there.</p>
<p>In the meantime, thank you everyone for viewing the show today.</p>
<p>Jeff, who do we have next week?</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                I&#8217;m ready this time. We have Stu Miniman from Wikibon, and he is the co-host of theCUBE.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Sweet. That should be fun.</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                Yeah.</p>
<p>Niki Acosta:               Good deal. Well, Ruchi thank you so much again, and we&#8217;ll see you in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                Yeah. Thank you Ruchi.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Thank you. Thank you guys for having me over.</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                Good bye everyone.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       I loved it.</p>
<p>Jeff Dickey:                All right, bye.</p>
<p>Ruchi Bhargava:       Bye.</p>
